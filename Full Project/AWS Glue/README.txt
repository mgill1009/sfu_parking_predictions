DESCRIPTION:
This folder contains the ETL scripts used in the AWS Glue service. These jobs process raw parking event data stored in S3 and generate aggregated historical metrics for analytics and dashboard visualization.


FOLDER STRUCTURE:

├── processing_raw_events.py
└── history_summarizer.py


CONTENTS:
· processing_raw_events.py - processes the previous day's raw parking events generated by the simulator and stored in the S3 data lake. Cleans and transforms logs, checks for missing or inconsistent fields (like missing departure), and writes processed results into processes/simulator_data partition structure in S3. This job prepares clean data for analytics.
· history_summarizer.py - aggregates the cleaned historical event data into hourly metrics for each parking lot. Computes average occupancy, peak spikes, and average duration, and writes these metrics into the histgorical_metrics table in PostgreSQL.


HOW IT WORKS:
Triggering: both jobs run once per dat scheduled in AWS Glue. They operate on yesterday's data ONLY. 
- processing_raw_events.py runs every day at 1:00 AM preparing the cleaned data.
- history_summarizer.py runs every day at 2:00 AM and aggregates the prepared data into historical metrics.
